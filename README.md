# Truth Graph Viewer

Interactive browser viewer for truth graphs extracted from CMSSW. The app reads a Graphviz DOT truth graph, converts it to JSON, and displays it with Cytoscape.js. It can also load rechit coordinates from a ROOT file and show direct or descendant hits in a Plotly 3D panel.

The current app is about simulation truth graph exploration, not CMSSW module dependency/configuration browsing.

## What It Does

- Displays `GenEvent`, `GenVertex`, `GenParticle`, `SimVertex`, `SimTrack`, and combined Gen+Sim nodes.
- Preserves DOT attributes and shows them in the side panel.
- Builds compact node labels from particle IDs, vertex keys, and DOT attributes.
- Supports search, advanced attribute search, focus radius, upstream/downstream link filters, and multiple layouts.
- Exports the current Cytoscape viewport as PNG or PDF.
- Runs either as a static HTML page with embedded JSON or through the local Python server.
- In server mode, accepts upload of a DOT graph and optional ROOT rechits file.

## Quick Start

```bash
cd CMSSWGraphViz
chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh
```

`run.sh` creates `venv/` if needed, installs Python dependencies, builds `data/bundle.json` from the selected DOT file, generates `app/js/bundle.js` for static mode, and starts `server.py`.

By default it looks for the first existing file from:

1. `./truthgraph.dot`
2. `../truthgraph.dot`
3. `./dependency.gv`

Use another DOT file with:

```bash
./run.sh --dot /path/to/truthgraph.dot
```

The server prints the selected application URL. By default it starts at:

```text
http://localhost:8009/app/
```

If that port is busy, `server.py` tries subsequent ports.

## Static Mode

After generating the embedded JavaScript bundle, the app can be opened directly:

```bash
python preprocess/build_bundle.py truthgraph.dot data/bundle.json
open app/index.html
```

Static mode uses:

- `app/js/bundle.js`, generated from `data/bundle.json`
- `app/js/rechits.js`, optionally generated from `data/rechits.json`

File upload is hidden in static mode because uploads require the Python server.

The workspace parent may contain example DOT files, but the application repository is this `CMSSWGraphViz/` directory.
